![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Completed-34A853?style=flat&label=Project&labelColor=23555555)

## Executive Summary

ðŸ”— **Links:** [Live Model](https://leads.dataproject.io "Access model for real-time lead inference") | [Model Training and Evaluation Repository](https://github.com/tmoesl/lead-conversion-prediction "Explore data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.")

This repository contains the deployment infrastructure for ExtraaLearnâ€™s Lead Conversion Prediction application, which leverages an optimized Random Forest model (Recall: 0.88, Accuracy: 0.83) to predict lead conversion for an EdTech startup, helping prioritize high-potential leads. 

By identifying key conversion driversâ€”such as website engagement, initial interaction channels, and profile completionâ€”the model enables data-driven resource allocation to boost conversion rates and optimize marketing strategies.

**Key Features**
- **Real-Time Predictions**: AI-powered lead scoring with a trained Random Forest model.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Analyze lead attributes to assess conversion probability.
- **Seamless Integration**: Export predictions for further analysis and strategic planning.

**Business Impact**
- **Maximize ROI**: Focus efforts on leads with the highest conversion potential.
- **Enhance Decision-Making**: Utilize data insights to refine marketing and sales strategies.
- **Optimize Marketing**: Leverage conversion drivers to refine campaigns.

## Introduction
This repository provides the end-to-end deployment infrastructure for ExtraaLearnâ€™s Lead Conversion Prediction application. The platform transforms analytical insights into a fully operational application, allowing sales and marketing teams to make data-driven decisions in lead prioritization. 
The application integrates a trained **Random Forest model**, which identifies key lead conversion drivers, helping businesses improve their marketing efficiency and optimize customer acquisition costs.

## Application Infrastructure
The application is structured as a microservices-based system, ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability:

1. **Frontend (Streamlit UI)**: An interactive interface for lead scoring, visualization, and report generation.
2. **Backend (FastAPI Service)**: Exposes a RESTful API for lead scoring using the trained model, with endpoints for prediction and health checks.
3. **Model Service**: A containerized ML inference service for real-time predictions using the trained model.

This architecture ensures that each component operates independently, supporting efficient scaling and maintenance.


## Deployment Infrastructure
The application is deployed on AWS EC2, leveraging Docker for containerization and Docker Compose for orchestration. The infrastructure includes:

- **Containerization**: Docker containers for consistent environment and simplified deployment.
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose for multi-container management.
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS EC2 for hosting the application with ALB for traffic distribution and Route 53 for domain management.

This architecture guarantees secure, reliable performance and efficient scalability.
